# Income-Spreadsheet
Income Spreadsheet designed with MN CCAP workers in mind

Can handle multiple different scenarios, including:
* Standard Earned income and hours by pay period.
* Earned income by Year-to-Date – from either year start or within a date range.
* Calculating Unemployment Insurance exhaustion date.
* Child Support, with scripting to separate dates from dollars if copied and pasted from PRISM together.
* Expenses.

Additional features include:
* Earned income sheets have Contract Period and Leave fields, to calculate partial annual income offline.
* Buttons to reset all sheets, as well as copy data converted to sentences for case noting.

Recent changes:
* Reduced the number of tabs by combining functionality; the previous version had tabs for biweekly, semimonthly, etc. for both calculating by pay periods and YTD - replaced by drop-downs.
* Notes and coloration added to indicate editable fields. Spreadsheet is ‘protected’ but not password locked. File is also marked as Read Only.
* Coloration hides itself (via script) when being printed.
* Added Semimonthly to YTD and YTD Range tabs.
